# Ricoh / Fujitsu fi-70F on SANE (epjitsu) — reverse-engineering findings

Status: **full, gap-free, correctly-calibrated colour scans of the fi-70F on Linux.** Read path,
descramble geometry, and the calibration operating point are all solved and hardware-verified
against the Windows PaperStream output. The only remaining difference from Windows is the output
**tone curve** (gamma), which is a SANE-appropriate, user-adjustable choice — see *Remaining
difference*. Everything below is verified on real hardware (a fi-70F on firmware `0000`) and, where
noted, against a USBPcap trace of the Windows driver plus a purpose-built self-decoding target.

Tracking issue: <https://gitlab.com/sane-project/backends/-/issues/833>

> **2026-07-07 update.** An earlier iteration of this document described the descramble as 3 heads
> of **433** px at plane offsets **68/2258/4448** with a constant rotation `SHIFT_S0=939` and 24
> interpolated "dead" pixels per head. **That was wrong** (it left ~2 seam gaps / a blurred seam).
> Using a self-decoding Gray-code target as an oracle, the true geometry is now solved and the
> seams are gap-free with no interpolation — details below. The read-path / trailer story is
> unchanged and still correct.

## How it was verified (the oracle)

We printed a **self-decoding target**: the top band is a 9-track **Gray-code absolute-position
encoder** — every output column encodes its own true X (`pos p = (x−90)/4`, 265 positions). Below
it are neutral-gray and per-channel step wedges. Because every column self-identifies, the scan is
its own ruler:

- **Descramble is correct ⟺ decoding the 9 tracks down each output column yields a continuous
  `0…264` ramp with no jumps.** A seam gap shows up as a jump in the ramp.
- **Colour is correct ⟺ the neutral wedge reads `R≈G≈B`.**

Ground truth is the Windows PaperStream scan of the same physical target (a lossless 1240×1748
image), plus its cold-start USBPcap. We also captured our own scan's raw over `usbmon` and confirmed
it is **byte-structurally identical** to the Windows raw — so *emission was never the problem*; both
descramble to a flat white (ours σ≈5.7, Windows σ≈4.5 across columns).

## TL;DR #1 (read path) — strip the 8-byte block trailer

The fi-70F closes **every 87-line scan block with an 8-byte trailer** (`02 <len:3> 00 00 80 00`),
so each device block is `87 × 6000 + 8 = 522008` bytes. The driver must **strip that trailer**.

Leaving it inline (we originally believed "no trailer on this device") embeds ~20 trailers in the
raw buffer, shifting every block 8 bytes late — which *looked* like a per-block horizontal "drift"
we once curve-fit with `shift = 939 + 429.75·block`. Strip the trailer and the drift vanishes
(measured per-block jump `430.374 px → 0.008 px`); the descramble becomes a plain fixed per-line
permutation. *Lesson: index by absolute device-stream position, never by transfer block.*

## TL;DR #2 (geometry) — 3 heads of 432, tiled with no dead pixels

The "seam gaps" were **not** an emission or calibration problem — they were a descramble bug:
plane offset `+68` and head width `409/433` were both wrong. `68/3` is **non-integer**, so the
`+68` "dead-lead" *misaligned the 3-way byte interleave*; and 409 truncated exactly the head-edge
pixels that fill the seams. With the correct geometry the three heads tile continuously.

## TL;DR #3 (colour) — match Windows' coarse operating point, not just the fine-cal

The cyan cast is set by the **coarse (analog) operating point**. Windows converges to *per-channel*
gains `0x37/0x35/0x34` and offsets `0x22/0x23/0x21`; the old code forced a single shared gain at the
wrong target, so red stayed under-gained. Sending Windows' converged c6 verbatim + a real per-pixel
fine-cal table makes the neutral wedge neutral.

## Device overview

- USB `05ca:0308`, firmware-upload device (`Comp70fFirmFile`, an `NDL1` blob, from PaperStream IP).
  Revisions seen: `70f_0000.nal` (this unit) and `70f_0A00.nal` (@tete17's). Config:
  `firmware .../70f_0000.nal` + `usb 0x05ca 0x0308`.
- 3-read-head CIS sensor, colour, 300 and 600 dpi optical. Belongs in **epjitsu** (with the
  fi-60F/fi-65F), not fujitsu.

## Read path (`read_from_scanner`, `sane_read`)

The fi-70F **free-runs** the whole page from a single `0x1B 0xD2` with no inter-block pacing.
What makes a full page stream end-to-end:

1. **Buffer the whole page as ONE block** (`block_img.height = fullscan.height`); descramble once.
2. **Request `0xFE00` (65024) bytes per bulk-IN**; don't clamp to the block remainder.
3. **Strip the 8-byte per-block trailer** (`522008 = 87×6000 + 8`), tracking device-stream position
   (`dev_pos`) so a trailer split across a read is handled correctly.
4. **Keep the captured SET_WINDOW `ypix = 0x6d8` (1752, 8-aligned)**.

## Descramble (`descramble_raw`, `MODEL_FI70F`, main scan) — SOLVED

Each raw 6000-byte line is 3 colour planes at byte offsets **0 / 2190 / 4380** (plane stride 2190).
Within a plane the 3 read-heads are **byte-interleaved**: head *h*, pixel *k* = `plane[k*3 + h]`,
each head **432** px wide (`432 × 3 = 1296` bytes/plane). The heads tile (horizontally mirrored)
into the **1240-px** output; output column *x* reads:

| output column x | head (interleave) | in-head pixel |
|---|---|---|
| `x ≤ 402` | 2 | `402 − x` |
| `403 ≤ x ≤ 834` | 1 | `834 − x` |
| `x ≥ 835` | 0 | `1265 − x` |

with byte `= pixel*3 + interleave`, and `R = plane0[byte]`, `G = plane1[byte]`, `B = plane2[byte]`.
The heads tile at pitch 432 with ~1 px overlap — **no rotation, no dead-lead skip, no interpolation.**
(The derivation: correlate each golden column's full vertical profile against every raw byte-column
→ an assumption-free raw→output map at corr 0.95–0.98; it collapses to the table above. This matches
@tete17's independent `3×432 → 1296` segment model.)

**Verification:** decoding the encoder over a fresh Linux scan gives **265/265 positions, zero ramp
jumps** (continuous `0…264`), row-aligned to the Windows golden at per-column corr ≈ 0.95. The old
409/433 geometry left ~2 seam gaps.

## 600 dpi

The fi-70F's second native optical resolution works the same way at ~2× scale; the geometry was
re-derived from a Windows 600 dpi capture with the same golden→raw correlation, then confirmed with
the encoder target as the oracle:

- **Read path:** raw line = **8544 bytes** (= 3 × xpix 2848); device block = **61 lines + 8-byte
  trailer** (521192 B). The trailer strip is resolution-aware (87 lines @300 dpi, 61 @600). Windows'
  captured coarse/fine cal blobs and the `ypix=64` (cal) / `ypix=3503` (scan) windows are sent verbatim.
- **Descramble:** 3 colour planes at byte offsets **0 / 2940 / 5874** — the offset **must** be
  interleave-phase-aligned (`offset % 3 == 0`); e.g. 2942 is off-phase and scrambles the heads.
  Within a plane the 3 heads are byte-interleaved as at 300 dpi; the per-head column map is
  `x ≤ 796 → head 2, pixel = 796−x`; `797…1660 → head 1, 1660−x`; `x ≥ 1661 → head 0, 2524−x`.
  Output is **2480 px**. Verified **265/265 encoder positions, 0 jumps**.
- **Head seams:** switch heads at the *outgoing* head's inner edge (pixel ≈ 0). Switching earlier
  lands on the *incoming* head's dark, vignetted far edge — which produced a 12-column black seam at
  ⅓ width until the crossover was moved to 796. Each head's own last 1–2 edge pixels are still
  slightly dim, so those two columns at each crossover are blended from their bright neighbours
  (600 dpi only; 300 dpi head edges are clean). Result: no visible seam.
- **Calibration** follows the 300 dpi recipe with the 600 dpi coarse operating point and a captured
  17088-byte fine table; the grey wedge is neutral (max channel deviation ~14).

The backend advertises only the two native resolutions (300 and 600 dpi) — the descramble is
per-resolution and does not rescale.

## Calibration — coarse operating point + per-pixel fine-cal

The brightness pipeline is coarse (analog gain/offset/exposure via the `0x1B 0xC6` payload) → fine
(per-pixel `[offset,gain]` via `0xC3`/`0xC4`) → LUT (`0xC5`).

- **Coarse:** send the fi-70F's converged operating point verbatim — offset `0x22/0x23/0x21`, gain
  `0x37/0x35/0x34`, exposure `0x0892/0x02dd/0x05b7` (`coarseCalData_FI70F`). These are Windows'
  converged values (traced through its c6 bisection in the USBPcap). The stock epjitsu coarse loop
  drives a *single shared* gain to an average target, which can't reach these per-channel gains —
  that was the real cyan cause, so `coarsecal()` sends the fixed payload for `MODEL_FI70F` instead
  of bisecting.
- **Fine:** a real per-pixel flat-field table (`fineCalData_FI70F`, 2000 px × 3 × 2 B). The built-in
  2-point sweep **pegs red** here — the sensor's red barely responds to the `0xff→0xbf` fine-gain
  probe, so red maxes out still under target and stays under-corrected. The table used is the one
  Windows computes for this sensor (captured from the trace); `finecal()` memcpys it (env
  `FI70F_FINECAL=<file>` / `=compute` override the default for experiments).

**Verification (fresh Linux scan vs the Windows golden):**

| metric | old build | this build | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|
| encoder ramp | ~2 seam gaps | **265/265, 0 jumps** | 265/265 |
| neutral-wedge max channel deviation | ~70 (cyan) | **7.6** | ~3 |
| white uniformity (σ across columns) | — | **3.1** (flat) | 6.9 |

## Remaining difference — tone / gamma (not a defect)

Our midtones read ~37 counts darker and blacks ~11 lighter than the Windows golden (neutral wedge
patch "175": ours ≈ 94 vs Windows ≈ 131; the "0" patch: ours ≈ 14 vs 1). This is the **`0xC5`
gamma LUT**: PaperStream bakes in a contrasty curve (crushed blacks, boosted mids), while SANE's
`send_lut` generates a more linear curve driven by the user's gamma/brightness/contrast options.
Colour balance and geometry match; only the baked-in contrast differs, which is arguably the right
default for SANE. Windows' exact `0xC5` LUT is captured and can be replayed if an identical tone is
ever wanted.

## Method notes / credits

- Cross-checked against a USBPcap trace of Windows PaperStream (trailer; the `0xC7/0xC6/0xC3/0xC4/
  0xC5` cal sequence and c6 convergence; 1240-px output) and a self-decoding Gray-code target.
- **Trust the data, not the render:** every claim here is a number (decoded encoder positions,
  per-channel wedge values, raw byte structure), because rendered images repeatedly misled this
  effort.
- Complementary to **@tete17**'s `0A00`-firmware `MODEL_FI70F`; the `3×432→1296` geometry agrees.
- Reverse-engineering and write-up by **Devin Cooper**; every finding verified on real hardware.
